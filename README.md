# tic-tac-toe

This project contains a tic-tac-toe game taking into consideration a value to set the size of the grid
not that the initial tic-tac-toe isn't hard enough, now we can play it in a bigger scale 



# Branches
### 2Players1Machine
this branch allows 2 players to play at the same time

### SecondPlayerControlledByMachine (which is currently merged in main)
as the name states , you'll be playing against the machine. 
The positions in which the machine will be playing will be random , so if you lose you should go learn more tic-tac-toe basics. 



# Rules
Who ever wins 3 rounds in a row WINS THE GAME , and then the gama will restart . Very simple
